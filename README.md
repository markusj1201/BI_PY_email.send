Scheduled emails with Python for BI
As part of reporting in business intelligence, scheduled emails are a very useful tool. They allow you to send various daily summaries, or attach larger reports.

For these purposes I put together a Python BI-mailer class to allow for easy management of all things you might normally require to send, such as text, summary/KPI html tables, embedded images or charts, or attach larger reports.

I will put the code here, and in the next articles I will give examples of how to use this easy Python emailer to accomplish daily reporting chores.

With this script you are able to:
send an email
optionally with text or multiple tables in body
optionally with attachments
optionally use the attachments as embedded images.
